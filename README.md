The project was created as a final assignment for the JavaScript Developer course. The main technologies used are JavaScript and SASS. The project was built using the React library. The goal of the game is to answer questions. The project includes a leaderboard where you can find the top ten players who have completed the game in the shortest time. The questions are random, and the difficulty level increases with each question. I strive to regularly enhance the project, with plans to improve certain functionalities and add additional technologies.
